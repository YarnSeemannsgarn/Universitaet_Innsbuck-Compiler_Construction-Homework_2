How to run the programme
========================

First of all build the programme:

      $ make

Afterwards you can run the progamme (solution) with an input file and an output file. The output file will be the input file with capitalized keywords, non-redundant whitespaces and old-style Pascal comments:

      $ ./solution sampleWithModula2Comments.pas sampleWithModula2Comments_gen.pas

If you want to clean up just do:

      $ make clean

Where is solution for task 2
============================

You can find the context-free grammar for Mini-Pascal language in task2.txt.
